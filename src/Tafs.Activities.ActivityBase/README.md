# Tafs.Activities.ActivityBase

This package is **obsolete** and is **no longer maintained**.

This library provides an AsyncTaskCodeActivity for NetFx, Net6.0, and Net7.0. This type has since been merged with the System.Activities namespace in the [CoreWF](https://github.com/UiPath/CoreWF) project. The types there should be preferred.
